Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by.

As a dedicated researcher in mathematical biology, I am driven by a profound commitment to advancing scientific knowledge for a better tomorrow. This website serves as a platform to share my research findings, insights and the latest developments in the dynamic field of mathematical biology.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at [Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology \& Research](https://vignan.ac.in/newvignan/people.php) (Deemed to be University), Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India.

I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, [Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning](https://www.sssihl.edu.in/), India, specializing in Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control Theory with applications in Mathematical Biology. 

Previously, I served for three years as a Research Fellow on a project funded by [National Board of Higher Mathematics](http://www.nbhm.dae.gov.in/), DAE, Government of India, contributing significantly to its progress and outcomes.

My academic background offers a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied mathematics. My research journey has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills and deepened my passion for teaching and mentoring students. I have a Masters degree in Mathematics specialized in Computer Science from [Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning](https://www.sssihl.edu.in/) , India.
